A JavaScript Game project from freeCodeCamp.org where using JS I learned to draw the game board, create the snake and randomly generated food, make the snake move, increase the snake size when it eats, and increase its speed. 
It also keeps the score, tracks collisions for the snake, and displays your high score.
