A JavaScript Game project from freeCodeCamp.org where using JS I learned how to draw the game board, create the snake, randomly generate food, make the snake move, increase the snake size when it eats, and increase its speed. 
It also keeps score, tracks collisions for the snake, and displays your high score.
